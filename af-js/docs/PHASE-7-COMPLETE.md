## Agent Coordination

### UI & Interaction Agent (05) - Primary

**Responsibilities:**
- Designed and implemented all 4 modals
- Created animation system for visual feedback
- Integrated UI components into game flow
- Handled async/await patterns for modal callbacks

### Game State Agent (01) - Supporting

**Responsibilities:**
- Added territory selection validation
- Implemented Raiders Outpost theft logic
- Added re-roll tracking (once-per-turn)
- Maintained game state consistency

### Board Facilities Agent (02) - Referenced

**Context Used:**
- Colonist Hub facility behavior (track system)
- Colony placement rules (4 per territory)
- Resource costs for facilities

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Promise-Based Modal Pattern

**Decision:** Use Promise callbacks instead of event emitters  
**Rationale:** Cleaner async/await syntax, easier to follow control flow  
**Implementation:** Each modal accepts a callback that resolves the promise

```typescript
const territoryId = await new Promise<string | null>((resolve) => {
  this.territorySelectorModal.show(territories, player, (selected) => {
    resolve(selected);
  });
});
```

### 2. Post-Execution Territory Selection for Colonist Hub

**Decision:** Show modal AFTER facility execution, not before  
**Rationale:** Colony placement depends on having resources (1 fuel + 1 ore)  
**Implementation:** Check `colonyPlaced` flag in results, then show modal retroactively

### 3. Floating Text Positioning

**Decision:** Center screen (768, 300) with horizontal offsets  
**Rationale:** Visible regardless of player HUD layout, doesn't overlap board  
**Implementation:** Resource texts offset by +80px for each additional resource

### 4. Animation Timing

**Decision:** Colony bounce: 500ms + 150ms, Floating text: 1500-2000ms  
**Rationale:** Noticeable but not disruptive, allows multiple animations  
**Implementation:** Phaser tweens with easing functions (Back.easeOut, Cubic.easeOut)

### 5. Re-roll Button Placement

**Decision:** Next to ROLL button in main player HUD  
**Rationale:** Logically grouped with dice rolling actions  
**Implementation:** Button hidden by default, shown conditionally based on territory control

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Colony Animation Identification

**Issue:** Cannot reliably identify specific colony sprite after `updateColonySprites()`  
**Workaround:** Animate last sprite in array (most recently added)  
**Impact:** Works correctly for single placement, multiple placements animate last one only  
**Future Fix:** Add unique ID to ColonySprite class

### 2. Resource Text Overlap

**Issue:** Many resource changes at once can overlap horizontally  
**Current:** Simple +80px offset  
**Impact:** 3+ resources may look crowded  
**Future Fix:** Vertical stacking or queue system

### 3. No Animated Territory Control Change

**Issue:** Territory control glow pulse method created but not called anywhere  
**Reason:** Control change detection not implemented in `resolveActions()`  
**Impact:** Minor - control still updates, just no visual feedback  
**Future Fix:** Track control before/after in GameState, call `animateTerritoryControlChange()`

### 4. AI Players Skip UI

**Issue:** AI players don't trigger modals (intended behavior)  
**Current:** AI uses internal logic for territory/theft decisions  
**Impact:** No visual feedback for AI choices  
**Future Fix:** Could show notifications for AI actions (already in AIActionAnimator)

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Path Tests

1. **Full Game Flow:** Human player completes all facility types in one game
2. **AI vs Human:** Verify AI skips UI correctly, human gets prompts
3. **Multiple Colonies:** Place 3-4 colonies in single turn (Constructor + Terraforming + Colonist Hub)
4. **Raiders Full Flow:** Test both resource and tech theft paths
5. **Re-roll Edge Cases:** Re-roll after partial ship placement

### Performance Tests

1. **Animation Stress Test:** Trigger 5+ animations simultaneously
2. **Memory Leak Test:** Play 10 consecutive games, monitor memory usage
3. **Modal Spam Test:** Open/close modals rapidly
4. **Long Game Test:** 4-player game to completion (100+ turns)

### Regression Tests

1. **Basic Facilities:** All 11 facilities still work
2. **Ship Docking:** Drag-and-drop unchanged
3. **Resource Management:** Gaining/spending still correct
4. **Turn Flow:** ROLL → PLACE → RESOLVE → NEXT still works
5. **Victory:** 4 colonies triggers win screen

5. Add accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader)
6. Implement game save/load system
7. Add replay system for AI games

### Phase 9: Multiplayer (If Desired)

**Potential Tasks:**
1. WebSocket server for real-time multiplayer
2. Game lobby system
3. Turn timer enforcement
4. Spectator mode
5. Chat system
