## ðŸ“‹ Task List

### Task 1: Solar Converter Facility âœ… NEXT
**Goal**: Implement Solar Converter action - gain 1 fuel per die placed

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Update Solar Converter facility class with action implementation
- [ ] Add fuel resource tracking to GameState
- [ ] Create facility action execution in GameScene
- [ ] Add visual feedback (fuel counter update)
- [ ] Test Solar Converter action flow
- [ ] Write unit tests

**Files to modify**:
- `src/game/facilities/solar-converter.ts`
- `src/scenes/game-scene.ts`
- `src/game/game-state.ts`

---

### Task 2: Lunar Mine Facility
**Goal**: Implement Lunar Mine action - gain 1 ore per die placed

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Update Lunar Mine facility class
- [ ] Add ore resource tracking
- [ ] Implement action execution
- [ ] Add visual feedback
- [ ] Test and validate

---

### Task 3: Orbital Market Facility
**Goal**: Implement Orbital Market - trade resources and buy tech cards

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Implement resource trading (ore â†” fuel)
- [ ] Implement tech card purchase
- [ ] Create trade UI modal
- [ ] Add resource validation
- [ ] Test trading logic

---

### Task 4: Colony Constructor Facility
**Goal**: Implement Colony Constructor - place colonies on territories

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Implement colony placement logic
- [ ] Add territory selection UI
- [ ] Validate placement rules
- [ ] Update territory control
- [ ] Add colony sprites to board
- [ ] Calculate victory points

---

### Task 5: Facility Action System
**Goal**: Create unified facility action execution system

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Create FacilityActionManager class
- [ ] Define action execution interface
- [ ] Implement action validation
- [ ] Add action rollback for undo
- [ ] Create action history tracking

---

## ðŸ”„ Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks: 0 / 10+

### Current Focus
Starting with Task 1: Solar Converter - the simplest facility to establish the pattern

### Blockers
None currently

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

For each facility implementation:
1. Unit tests for facility action logic
2. Integration tests for GameState updates
3. Manual testing in browser
4. AI testing (ensure AI can use the facility)

---

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

Phase 6 is complete when:
- âœ… All 10 facilities have working implementations
- âœ… Tech cards can be purchased and used
- âœ… Victory conditions work correctly
- âœ… AI can play complete games
- âœ… All tests pass
- âœ… Game feels polished and complete
