**Build**: Hash ed657bb420b9872561a9

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Game

**Option A: Development Server (Recommended)**
```powershell
cd s:\Dev\AlienFrontiers\af-js
$env:NODE_OPTIONS='--openssl-legacy-provider'
npm run dev
```
Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:8080`

**Option B: Build and Open**
```powershell
cd s:\Dev\AlienFrontiers\af-js
$env:NODE_OPTIONS='--openssl-legacy-provider'
npm run build
```
Then open `dist/index.html` in your browser.

### 2. Run Automated Tests

```powershell
cd s:\Dev\AlienFrontiers\af-js
npm test
```

**Expected Result**: 325/325 tests passing ✅

## Integration Testing Checklist

Use this simplified checklist for quick verification. Full details in `PHASE-8-INTEGRATION-TESTING.md`.

### ✅ Basic Functionality (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Game Starts**: Main menu appears, can click "Play"
- [ ] **Player Setup**: Can configure 2-4 players, select AI difficulties
- [ ] **Dice Roll**: Click "Roll Dice", dice animate and show results
- [ ] **Place Colony**: Use Colony Constructor, modal appears with animation
- [ ] **Territory Control**: Verify control updates when colonies placed

### ✅ Visual Polish (3 minutes)

- [ ] **Territory Selector Modal**:
  - [ ] Has blue outer glow
  - [ ] Has inner highlight
  - [ ] Fades in smoothly (200ms animation)
  - [ ] Scales from 0.9 to 1.0
  
- [ ] **Other Modals** (Raiders, Player Selector, Resource Picker):
  - [ ] Same glow/highlight effects
  - [ ] Same smooth entrance animations

### ✅ Core Features (10 minutes)

- [ ] **Colony Constructor**: Place colonies, control updates correctly
- [ ] **Terraforming Station**: Swap dice, resources deducted
- [ ] **Raiders Outpost**: 
  - [ ] Modal choice appears (Resources vs Tech)
  - [ ] Player selector works with animations
  - [ ] Resources transferred correctly
- [ ] **Colonist Hub**: Upgrade colony to city, control recalculated
- [ ] **Re-roll Button**: Works once per turn, costs 1 ore

### ✅ Visual Feedback (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Resource Text**: 
  - [ ] Floats up from facilities
  - [ ] Shows Ore, Fuel, Energy correctly
  - [ ] Stacks vertically (no overlap)
  - [ ] Fades out smoothly
  
- [ ] **Territory Control Animation**:
  - [ ] Blue glow pulses on territory name when control changes
  - [ ] Visible but not distracting

### ✅ AI Behavior (5 minutes)

- [ ] **AI Easy**: Makes decisions quickly (1-3s)
- [ ] **AI Medium**: Makes reasonable decisions (3-8s)
- [ ] **AI Hard**: Makes strategic decisions (8-15s)
- [ ] **AI Actions**: Notifications show AI choices clearly

### ✅ Edge Cases (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Full Territory**: Colony Constructor disabled when territory full
- [ ] **No Resources**: Cannot perform action without required resources
- [ ] **Re-roll Used**: Button disabled after first use per turn
- [ ] **Victory**: Game ends at 8 victory points, shows winner

## Performance Verification

Open Browser Developer Tools (F12) and monitor:

### Console Tab
- [ ] No error messages (red text)
- [ ] No warning messages about performance

### Performance Tab
1. Start recording
2. Play through several turns
3. Stop recording

**Check:**
- [ ] FPS: 55-60 (shown in Performance monitor)
- [ ] No long tasks blocking main thread
- [ ] Smooth animations throughout

### Memory Tab
1. Take heap snapshot at start
2. Play 10-20 turns
3. Take another snapshot

**Check:**
- [ ] Memory stable (80-130 MB range)
- [ ] No continuous growth (memory leak)
- [ ] GC happens periodically (saw-tooth pattern is normal)

## Quick 2-Player Test (10 minutes)

This is the fastest way to verify everything works:

### Setup
1. Start game → Click "Play"
2. Player 1: Human, Blue
3. Player 2: AI Easy, Green
4. Click "Start Game"

### Turn 1 - Human
1. Click "Roll Dice" → Verify dice animate
2. Place colony using Colony Constructor → Verify modal animates
3. Check resource text floats up → Verify vertical stacking
4. Click "Done" → Turn passes to AI

### Turn 2 - AI Easy
1. AI rolls dice automatically
2. AI makes decision (watch notification)
3. Verify AI action completes
4. Turn returns to human

### Turn 3 - Human
1. Use Terraforming Station → Verify dice swap
2. Use Re-roll button → Verify costs ore, can't use twice
3. Continue playing...

### Victory
1. Play until either player reaches 8 points
2. Verify victory screen appears
3. Can return to main menu

## Known Issues (Documented, Not Blockers)

1. **ship-sprite.test.ts**: 1 test fails in Jest headless mode (requires DOM). Works fine in browser.
2. **webpack-dev-server**: May need `webpack-cli` installed. Use build + open HTML as alternative.

## Phase 7 Test Plan

For comprehensive testing, execute all 45 test cases in `PHASE-7-TESTING.md`:

```powershell
# Review the test plan
code s:\Dev\AlienFrontiers\af-js\docs\PHASE-7-TESTING.md
```

**Categories** (45 tests total):
1. Territory Selector (5 tests)
2. Raiders Outpost (4 tests)
3. Re-roll Button (5 tests)
4. Colonist Hub (5 tests)
5. Visual Feedback (5 tests)
6. AI Handling (4 tests)
7. Edge Cases (5 tests)
8. Performance (4 tests)
9. Regression (5 tests)
10. Integration (3 tests)

## Reporting Issues

If you find any bugs during testing:

1. **Note the issue**: What happened vs what should happen
2. **Steps to reproduce**: Exact sequence of actions
3. **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari?
4. **Console errors**: Check F12 Developer Tools console
5. **Save state**: Take screenshot if visual issue

**Example Bug Report:**
```
Issue: Territory control animation not playing
Steps: 1. Place colony on Asimov Crater
       2. Control changes from 0 to 1
       3. No blue glow animation appears
Expected: Blue glow should pulse on "Asimov Crater" text
Actual: No animation visible
Browser: Chrome 118
Console: No errors
```
