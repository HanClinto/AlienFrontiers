 Quick Play Reference
Objective
Have the most victory points by the end of the game through colony placement, territory control, and possession of certain alien tech cards.
Turn Flow
Each player performs all of these tasks on their turn.
􏰀 Gather your ships and roll them.
􏰀 Assign all of your ships to your choice of orbital facilities for which you qualify and gain benefits immediately.
􏰀 Use alien tech cards as appropriate at any time during your turn. Alien tech cards that require a fuel payment can only be used once per turn. You may only discard an alien tech card you have not already used on your current turn and then only one discard per turn.
􏰀 Once all ships have been assigned and alien tech used, discard down to eight resources.
􏰀 Turn passes to next player. Game End and Scoring
The game ends immediately when any player lands their final unplaced colony on a territory.
Score:
􏰀 1 VP per colony on a territory
􏰀 1 VP per territory you control
􏰀 1 VP for possession of the Alien City card
􏰀 1 VP for possession of the Alien Monument card
􏰀 1 VP for controlling the territory with the Positron Field
Ties are broken by number of alien tech cards. Persistent ties are broken by number of ore tokens, then by number of fuel tokens.
Alien Artifact
Each ship you dock gives you the option to discard the three alien tech cards on display and lay out three new ones. When your docked ships total more than 7 you may claim one of the displayed alien tech cards.
Colonist Hub
Dock ships of any value. If you do not have a colony on the track, place one with your first ship. Move your colony forward one space per ship docked. If your colony is on the final space on the track, pay 1 Fuel and 1 Ore to place the colony. Use only one track at a time.
Colony Constructor
Dock three ships of the same value. Pay 3 Ore to place a colony.
Lunar Mine
Dock ships greater than or equal to highest value on the Mine. Gain 1 Ore per ship.
Maintenance Bay
If you cannot place a ship legally during your turn, place it here. Maintenance Bay gives the player no benefit, but ships placed here are still considered in play and will be gathered with the player’s fleet on their next turn. Any ships purchased through the Shipyard or Burroughs Desert are placed here, as are ships removed from facilities with the Plasma Cannon or from use of the Raiders’ Outpost.
Orbital Market
Dock two ships of the same value. Trade Fuel equal to value of one ship for one Ore. Trading may be done multiple times.
Raiders’ Outpost
Dock three sequentially numbered ships. Steal a total of four resources or one alien tech card from your opponent(s). If the Raiders’ Outpost is occupied, you may dock a higher-value sequence and move the original ships to the Maintenance Bay.
Shipyard
Dock two ships of the same value. Pay Fuel and Ore to move one of your ships from ship stock to the Maintenance Bay : 1 each for your fourth ship, 2 each for your fifth, and 3 each for your sixth.
Solar Converter
Take fuel equal to half the value of each ship you dock here. Round up for each ship.
Terraforming Station

Game Play
Play begins with player one and moves clockwise. Each player performs the following tasks on their turn:
Gather and Roll Your Fleet
Gather all of your ships from the board and roll them.
Use Alien Tech Cards and Assign Your Fleet
Do these tasks in any order you like. You may choose to use all, some, or none of your alien tech cards but you must place all of your ships at orbital facilities on your turn if possible. If you cannot legally place one or more of your ships at any orbital facility, place them in the Maintenance Bay.
You may use an orbital facility by allocating your ships to its docking ports. A facility can only be used if it has sufficient unused docking ports, you have ships of the required values, and you can immediately pay any applicable cost. See the section on orbital facilities for the requirements and costs for each facility.
Example :
The terraforming station requires a value 6 ship and costs one fuel and one ore. Therefore, you may not use the terraforming station if you do not have any sixes, if the single docking port is already occupied, or if you do not have the required fuel and ore.
You gain the benefits of an orbital facility, territory control, or alien tech immediately unless noted otherwise.
Costs to use orbital facilities and alien tech cards are paid to the stocks.
You may use your alien tech cards at any time during your turn. Most cards have a power you pay fuel to use and a power you must discard the card to use. Each alien tech card may be used only once per turn. You may only use one discard power from your alien tech cards each turn. See the rules section on alien tech cards for the powers and costs of each card.
If you place a colony during your turn you earn a victory point and adjust the score track immediately. If colony placement results in your having more colonies on the territory than any other player, you “control” that territory. You take its counter, gain an extra victory point, and may use the territory’s bonus. If you no longer have more colonies on the territory than any other player, you lose control of the territory. You immediately return the territory card, lose a victory point, and can no longer use its bonus. See the rules section on territory bonuses for details.
The presence of certain field generators may award an extra victory point or limit your ability to use territory bonuses and place colonies. See the rules section on field generators for details.
End of Turn
When you have placed all your ships on the board and used any alien tech cards that you wanted to use, your turn is over. Leave your ships as you have placed them until your next turn.
If you have more than eight total resource tokens at the end of your turn you must
return your choice of excess
tokens to the appropriate
resource stocks.
End of Game and Scoring
Scoring is not cumulative. It is a snapshot of the current board and hand situation at any single point in time. Use the scoreboard to track the current standings throughout the game. Your score will fluctuate up and down as the game progresses, and each time circumstances change the scoreboard should be updated.
You score 1 victory point for...
􏰀 Each of your colony tokens on a territory
􏰀 Each territory you control
􏰀 Having the Alien City card
􏰀 Having the Alien Monument card
􏰀 Controlling the territory with the Positron Field
The game ends as soon as one player places their last colony on a territory. Players tally up their victory points to verify the standings on the scoreboard, and the player with the most victory points wins.
If there is a tie, the tied players compare their number of alien tech cards to determine the winner. Persistent ties can be resolved by comparing ore tokens then fuel tokens. Still tied? Play again!

Orbital Facilities
Surrounding the planet are the orbital facilities you will use to earn resources, expand your fleet, and land colonies. You may not dock ships at an orbital facility unless docking ports are available and you can meet both the ship and cost requirements.
Alien Artifact
Each ship you dock at the Alien Artifact may be of any value and allows you to discard the alien tech cards on display and lay out three new cards from the deck. This is called “cycling” and it is optional. To claim one of the alien tech cards on display you need to have docked ships with a total value of more than 7. Replace the claimed card with one from the draw pile. You may not claim an alien tech card you already have. There are enough docking ports to accommodate four ships at a time.
Example 1 :
There is a Polarity Device card on display and you want it, so you dock a 2 and a 6 at the Alien Artifact and take the card.
Example 2 :
You dock a 3 at the Alien Artifact and cycle the alien tech cards. There’s nothing you want so you dock a 2 and cycle the cards again. You still have not found what you want so you dock a 4 and cycle the cards a third time. The Plasma Cannon is now on display. Since your docked ships total more than 7 (3+2+4=9) you take the Plasma Cannon.
Example 3 :
After completing the moves in example 2 there is one dock open at the Alien Artifact. You could dock a fourth ship there and cycle the cards again but you could not claim a second alien tech card because the “more than 7” requirement is a separate total for each card you claim.
Colonist Hub
The Colonist Hub has four “advancement tracks” so that four players can use it simultaneously to ready colonies for territory placement. Each track contains three docking ports and seven advancement circles. Each player may not use more than one advancement track at a time.
If you do not have a colony at the Colonist Hub then the first ship placed here requires you to place one of your unplaced colonies on the first advancement circle. Each additional ship you dock here, either on this turn or on subsequent turns, must be placed on this same track until that colony is launched. Each ship docked advances the colony one circle. When the colony reaches the seventh and final advancement circle you may launch it at your convenience by paying one fuel and one ore. You may not begin work on another colony at the Colonist Hub until the one already on the advancement track has been launched. Once the
Alien Artifact
     Colonist Hub
 7
Colony Constructor

 Lunar Mine
colony has been placed on a territory you may start advancing a new colony with the next ship you dock at the Colonist Hub.
If you earn more advances than are needed to move your colony to the seventh circle (see Asimov Crater below) and launch the colony immediately, you may use the excess advances to begin work on a new colony.
Your final colony is not locked into the Colonist Hub. If your last colony is on the Colonist Hub and your roll gives you the opportunity to use the Terraforming Station or the Colony Constructor, you may remove the colony from the Colonist Hub and place it on a territory via the rules for those other facilities.
Colony Constructor
You must dock three ships of equal value and pay three ore to use the Colony Constructor. There are enough docking ports for two sets of triples to be docked simultaneously. Using the Colony Constructor allows you to land one of your unplaced colonies on a territory immediately.
Lunar Mine
Each new ship docked at the Lunar Mine must be equal to or greater than the highest value ship currently docked here. There are enough docking ports to accommodate five ships at any one time. You gain one ore for each ship you dock here.
Example :
At the beginning of your turn there is a 1 and a 4 docked at the Lunar Mine. You roll a 3, 4, and 6. You cannot dock the 3 at the Lunar Mine because it is less than the 4 already docked there, but you can dock both
your 4 and your 6. You earn two ore for docking both ships at the Lunar Mine. The Lunar Mine now has only one docking port free and the next player that wants to use it will need a 6.
Maintenance Bay
If you cannot place a ship legally during your turn, place it here. Maintenance Bay gives the player no benefit, but ships placed here are still considered in play and will be gathered with the player’s fleet on their next turn. Any ships purchased through the Shipyard or Burroughs Desert are placed here, as are ships removed from facilities with the Plasma Cannon or from use of the Raiders’ Outpost.
Orbital Market
You must dock two ships of equal value to use the Orbital Market. There are enough docking ports to accommodate two pairs of ships at any one time. While docked at the Orbital Market you may pay fuel equal to the value of one of your docked ships to receive one ore. You may trade as many times as you wish on your turn.
Example :
You dock a pair of 3s at the Orbital Market. On this turn you may pay three fuel to receive one ore. If you have six fuel you may do the trade twice. If you acquire three more fuel during your turn you may do the trade again.
Raiders’ Outpost
You must dock a set of three sequentially numbered ships to use the Raiders’ Outpost. There are docking ports for one set of three ships. If the Raiders’ Outpost is occupied, you may dock a higher-value sequence here and move the original ships to the Maintenance Bay.
   Orbital Market
   Raiders’ Outpost
8

While docked at the Raiders’ Outpost you may steal a total of four resources from any mix of players or one alien tech card of your choice from one player. If you steal an alien tech card that you already have, the stolen card is discarded immediately and you gain no benefit from doing so.
Example :
If a 1-2-3 is docked at the Raiders’ Outpost and the next player rolls a 2-3-4 then that player may remove the 1-2-3 and dock their 2-3-4 at the facility to conduct their own raid. If another player rolls a 3-4-5 or a 4-5-6 then they may remove the 2-3-4 and dock their own sequence and conduct their own raid.
Shipyard
You must dock two ships of equal value to use the Shipyard. There are enough docking ports to accommodate three pairs of ships at any one time. Each pair of docked ships, along with the payment of the appropriate fuel and ore, earns one new ship from the ship stock.
􏰀 4th ship : pay one fuel and one ore.
􏰀 5th ship : pay two fuel and two ore.
􏰀 6th ship : pay three fuel and three ore.
Take a ship of your color from the ship stock and place it in the Maintenance Bay. Claim it at the start of your next turn when you gather your fleet. If there are no ships of your color in the ship stock on your turn then you may not use the Shipyard. Because it is possible to lose ships while playing, you may build your 4th, 5th, or 6th ship more than once during the game.
Solar Converter
  You may dock ships of any value at the Solar Converter. There are enough docking ports to accommodate eight ships. You gain fuel equal to one half the value of each ship you dock here. Round up for each ship.
Example :
If you dock a 3 and a 4 at the solar converter you will receive two fuel for the 3 and two fuel for the 4.
Terraforming Station
You must dock one ship with a value of 6 and pay one fuel and one ore to use the Terraforming Station. There is only one docking port available at this facility. Using the Terraforming Station allows you to land one of your unplaced colonies on a territory immediately. The ship docked at the Terraforming Station is completely consumed by the colony creation process and is returned to the ship stock at the beginning of your next turn. A ship forfeited in this manner may be rebuilt using the Shipyard only after it has returned to the ship stock.
You cannot use the Terraforming Station if doing so would reduce your fleet to fewer than three ships of your color.
A ship docked at the Terraforming Station may not be re-used via the Orbital Teleporter card.

Territory Bonuses
Each territory grants its controlling player a bonus over some aspect of the game. A player controls a territory if they have more colonies on that territory than any other single player. The controlling player takes the territory counter.
Example:
Red has two colonies on Lem Badlands and Green, Yellow, and Blue each have one colony on Lem Badlands. Red has the most colonies on the territory so Red controls Lem Badlands.
A territory is not controlled by any player if two or more players are tied for the most colonies on a territory. No player earns the bonus for such a territory. The counter for a territory that is not controlled remains on the territory.
Example:
Red and Yellow each have two colonies on Lem Badlands and Green and Blue each have one colony on Lem Badlands. Red and Yellow are tied for the most colonies on the territory so it is not controlled by anyone and no one earns the territory’s bonus.
Asimov Crater
Advance your colony one extra level when you dock more than one ship at the Colonist Hub.
Example:
Docking two ships at the Colonist Hub would ordinarily advance your colony two levels. Since you control Asimov Crater, you advance your colony three levels. If you dock three ships at the Colonist Hub you would advance four levels.
Bradbury Plateau
Pay one less ore than usual when you use the Colony Constructor.
Example:
You dock a set of three 5s at the Colony Constructor to build a colony. Ordinarily you would be required to pay three ore to activate the facility. However, since you control Bradbury Plateau, you pay only two ore.
Burroughs Desert
Purchase the Relic Ship for 1 fuel and 1 ore. Place the ship on the Maintenance Bay and gather it with the rest of your fleet on your next turn. Return the ship to Burroughs Desert immediately if you lose control of this territory. The Relic Ship behaves exactly as any other ship in your fleet except that it has no color and any time the ship would be returned to the ship stock it is returned to Burroughs Desert instead.
See Terraforming Station and the discard power of a Plasma Cannon card for details. The player controlling Burroughs Desert may repurchase the Relic Ship on their turn.
Example 1:
You control Burroughs Desert with one colony and are using the Relic Ship. The next player builds a new colony and places it on Burroughs Desert. Now you both have one colony on Burroughs Desert so neither of you control the territory. You return the territory card and the Relic Ship to Burroughs Desert immediately.
Example 2:
Your Relic Ship is docked at the Lunar Mine. Another player discards a Stasis Beam and places the Isolation Field on Burroughs Desert. You must return the Relic Ship to the territory immediately and may not repurchase it until the Isolation Field is moved off Burroughs Desert.
Example 3:
Your Relic Ship has a 6 showing and you dock it at the Terraforming Station to build a colony. At the start of your next turn the Relic Ship returns to Burroughs Desert instead of the ship stock and you may repurchase it on that same turn.
Heinlein Plains
Your trading ratio is always 1 Fuel for 1 Ore when using the Orbital Market.
Example:
You roll double 3s and dock them at the Orbital Market. Ordinarily any trades you make on this turn would be at a three fuel for one ore ratio. However, since you control Heinlein Plains you always trade at a one fuel for one ore ratio regardless of your docked ship values.
    10

 Herbert Valley
Pay 1 less fuel and ore than usual for each ship you build at the Shipyard.
Example:
You dock a pair of ships at the Shipyard to build your 5th ship. Ordinarily you would also pay 2 fuel and 2 ore. However, since you control Herbert Valley you pay only 1 fuel and 1 ore. If it had been your 4th ship, the bonus from Herbert Valley would have allowed you to pay nothing at all.
Lem Badlands
Gain 1 additional fuel for each ship you dock at the Solar Converter.
Example:
You dock a 3 and 4 at the Solar Converter and receive the usual 4 fuel. Because you control Lem Badlands, you gain two extra fuel.
Pohl Foothills
Pay one less fuel than normal for each alien tech card you use.
Example 1:
You have a Booster Pod card which allows you to add 1 to the value of an unplaced ship at a cost of 1 fuel. Since you control Pohl Foothills, you pay nothing for this manipulation.
Example 2:
You have a Plasma Cannon card which allows you to remove opponents’ ships from an orbital facility at a cost of one fuel per ship. You choose to remove three ships from the Lunar Mine. Since you control Pohl Foothills you only pay 2 fuel for this action.
Van Vogt Mountains
The first ship you dock at the Lunar Mine each turn may be any value.
Example:
You rolled a 1, 2, 4, and 5 and the highest value ship at the Lunar Mine is currently a 5. Since you control Van Vogt Mountains, the first ship you dock at the Lunar Mine may be the 1, 2, or 4. If you want to receive a second ore you can also dock the 5 at the Lunar Mine.
    
Field Generators
The three field generators alter the rules within the territory where they are located and, where there is a conflict, take precedence over alien tech card effects.
Isolation Field
The Isolation Field nullifies a territory’s bonus. The first player to discard a Stasis Beam card will place the Isolation Field counter on a territory of their choice. Any subsequent player who discards a Stasis Beam card will move the counter to another territory.
Example:
If the Isolation Field is placed on Pohl Foothills, the player who controls that territory does not receive the “pay one less fuel than normal on each alien tech card you use” bonus and the bonus is not available to a player using a Data Crystal card.
Positron Field
The Positron Field awards one victory point to the player controlling the territory where it is located. The first player to discard a Data Crystal card will place the Positron Field counter on a territory of their choice. Any subsequent player who discards a Data Crystal card will move the counter to another territory.
Example:
If the Positron Field is located on Herbert Valley and the green player controls Herbert Valley, then the green player receives one additional victory point.
Repulsor Field
The Repulsor Field prevents colonies from being added to or removed from the territory on which it is located. The Repulsor Field does not prevent its own movement or removal, nor does it prevent the movement or removal of any other field generator that is also on that territory. The first player to discard a Gravity Manipulator card will place the Repulsor Field counter on a territory of their choice. Any subsequent player who discards a Gravity Manipulator card will move the counter to another territory.
Example:
If the Repulsor Field is on Asimov Crater then no new colonies may be added on that territory and the colonies already there cannot be swapped or removed by discarding a Polarity Device or Orbital Teleporter card.
                  
Alien Tech Cards
The alien tech cards allow you to bend the basic game rules. Most alien tech cards may be used immediately after you acquire them. Alien tech cards that require a fuel payment can only be used once per turn. You may only discard an alien tech card you have not already used on your current turn and then only one discard per turn.
Your alien tech cards are placed on the table face-up where all players can see them.
You may only possess one copy of each alien tech card.
If a card allows you to change a ship’s value then the value may never be lower than 1 or higher than 6.
If the alien tech draw deck is exhausted, reshuffle the discards to create a new draw deck.
Alien City and Alien Monument
Each of these cards is worth one victory point. There is one Alien City card and one Alien Monument card in the alien tech deck and a single player may possess both cards simultaneously. There is no fuel cost associated with these cards and they do not have discard powers.
Booster Pod
Each turn you may pay one fuel to increase the value of one of your unplaced ships by one point. You may discard a Booster Pod to remove any single field generator from the territory on which it is located. A field generator removed in this manner may be rebuilt in the normal manner at a later time.
Example:
You roll a 1, 3, and 4. You pay one fuel and use the Booster Pod’s power to raise the 3 to a 4 so that you can use the pair of 4s at the Shipyard.
Data Crystal
Each turn you may pay one fuel per colony on a territory to use that territory’s bonus exactly as if you controlled the territory. If a territory has no colonies on it then you cannot use its bonus. If the territory has the Isolation Field on it then you cannot use its bonus. Burroughs Desert is exempt from the Data Crystal’s power because its bonus plays out over more than a single turn. You may discard a Data Crystal to place the Positron Field on a territory or, if the Positron Field is already on a territory, move it to another territory.
Example:
You roll a 1, 6, and 6. You have a lot of fuel and you need to convert it to ore, but the pair of 6s gives you a very poor trading ratio at the Orbital Market. Heinlein Plains has one green colony and one red colony on it, so you pay two fuel and use your Data Crystal to borrow the Heinlein Plains bonus.
Gravity Manipulator
Each turn you may pay two fuel to decrease the value of one unplaced ship by one point and increase the value of another unplaced ship by one point. You may discard a Gravity Manipulator to place the Repulsor Field on a territory or, if the Repulsor Field is already on a territory, move it to another territory.
Example :
You roll a 1, 2, and 5. You pay two fuel and use the Gravity Manipulator to move one point from the 2 to the 5 making those two ships into a 1 and a 6.

 Gravity Manipulator
Holographic Decoy
There is no fuel cost associated with this card and it does not have a discard power. While you possess the Holographic Decoy a player may not use the Raiders’ Outpost to steal resources from you. If the raiding player wishes to steal an alien tech card from you then they may only take your Holographic Decoy. If the raiding player already has a Holographic Decoy then the stolen card is discarded.
Example :
The red player places three sequentially numbered ships on the Raiders’ Outpost. They would like to steal four ore from you but because you have the Holographic Decoy card your ore is safe. However, the red player decides to take your Holographic Decoy card instead.
Orbital Teleporter
Each turn you may pay two fuel to move one of your docked ships from one orbital facility to a different orbital facility. You may only move one of your ships with the Orbital Teleporter but the moved ship may be used at the new facility in conjunction with other as yet unplaced ships from your fleet. You may not reuse the ship at the same facility from which it was removed. You may not change the value of the ship as it moves from one facility to the other. You may not use the Orbital Teleporter to move a ship off of the Terraforming Station. You may discard the Orbital Teleporter to move any single colony from one territory to another territory. See Repulsor Field above for exceptions.
Example 1 :
You roll a 2, 5, and 6. You dock the 6 at the Lunar Mine and receive one ore. You then pay two fuel and use your Orbital Teleporter to move the 6 to the Alien Artifact. Next you dock the 2 at the Alien Artifact to bring the ship total to 8 and claim an alien tech card.
Example 2 :
You are the blue player. You and the red player both have a colony on Lem Badlands so neither of
you control it. You have one colony on Van Vogt Mountains but green has two colonies there so you are not likely to gain control of it any time soon. You discard your Orbital Teleporter card and move your colony from Van Vogt Mountains to Lem Badlands to gain control of that territory, claim the territory card, and receive the extra victory point.
Plasma Cannon
Each turn you may pay one fuel per ship to remove other players’ ships from one orbital facility. The removed ships are placed on the Maintenance Bay to be claimed when their players take their next turn (see example 2 below for an exception to this rule). The Plasma Cannon may only remove ships from a single orbital facility and you may not use the Plasma Cannon on your own ships. You may discard a Plasma Cannon to return one ship belonging to another player to the ship stock. The target player must have more than three ships of their color on the board. The Relic Ship does not count toward this tally. A ship removed in this manner may be regained as normal through use of the Shipyard.
Example 1 :
You are the blue player and roll a 2, 2, and 4. You want to use the pair of 2s at the Shipyard but all of the docks are full. You pay 2 fuel and use your Plasma Cannon to move two red ships from the Shipyard to the Maintenance Bay then dock your own ships at the Shipyard.
Example 2 :
You are the blue player and the red player has a ship on the Terraforming Station. You pay one fuel and use your Plasma Cannon to move the red ship off the Terraforming Station. Ordinarily a ship removed by the Plasma Cannon would go to the Maintenance Bay, but a ship on the Terraforming Station is forfeit on the player’s next turn so you return it to the ship stock instead.

 Orbital Teleporter
 Plasma Cannon

Example 3 :
You are the blue player and the yellow player has six ships on the board. You discard your Plasma Cannon to remove the yellow 6 from the Lunar Mine and return it to the ship stock.
Polarity Device
Each turn you may pay one fuel to flip one of your unplaced ships to its opposite face. You may discard a Polarity Device to swap the locations of any two colonies on any two territories. See Repulsor Field for exceptions.
Example 1 :
Yourolla1,2,and5.Youpayonefuelandusethe Polarity Device to flip the 1 to a 6.
Example 2 :
Herbert Valley has two yellow colonies on it and Lem Badlands has two red colonies on it. You discard the Polarity Device and swap one colony from each of those territories. Both territories now have one yellow colony and one red colony so neither red nor yellow control those two territories.
Resource Cache
You receive free resources each turn for as long as you possess the Resource Cache. Count the odd and even value ships after you roll your fleet but before you use any alien tech cards.
􏰀 If you have more odd ships, you receive one ore.
􏰀 If you have more even ships, you receive one fuel.
􏰀 If you have an equal number of odd and even ships you receive one fuel and one ore and you must immediately discard the Resource Cache.
Unlike every other alien tech card, the Resource Cache cannot be used on the turn you acquire it.
The Resource Cache card is only discarded if you roll equal numbers of odd and even valued ships.
Example :
You dock a 3 and a 6 at the Alien Artifact and claim a Resource Cache card. You do not gain any benefit from the card until your next turn when you gather and roll your fleet.
Stasis Beam
Each turn you may pay one fuel to decrease the value of one of your unplaced ships by one point. You may discard a Stasis Beam to place the Isolation Field on a territory or, if the Isolation Field is already on a territory, move it to another territory.
Example :
You roll a 1, 2 and 5. You pay one fuel and use the Stasis Beam’s power to decrease the 2 to a 1 so that you can use the pair of 1s to get a favorable trading ratio at the Orbital Market.
Temporal Warper
Each turn you may pay one fuel to re-roll as many of your unplaced ships as you like. You may discard a Temporal Warper to claim one alien tech card of your choice from the discard pile. You may look through the discard pile before discarding your Temporal Warper card.
Example 1 :
You roll a 1, 2, and 5. You use the Temporal Warper to re-roll the 1 and 2, hoping to get some higher numbers.
Example 2 :
You review the alien tech discard pile and see an Alien City card. You discard your Temporal Warper and take the Alien City card.
