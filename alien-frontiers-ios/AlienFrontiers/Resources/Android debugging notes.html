Android debugging notes:

When I got to the step that says: "Open a terminal, go to your build/android/LoomAndroidDemo folder and run ndk-gdb (this will create app_process and other needed files in later step)"

Because I already had my Android device plugged in, GDB didn't know who to connect to.  We might want to change that step to explicitly target the emulator, with the -e command line option.

Once I did that, I got the following long error message (but it started GDB):
